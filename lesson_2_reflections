1) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

I see the message "you initialized an empty repository". To create a commits to my projects.

2) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is a part of Git and Working directory it's just directory on your own computer. It offers us some additional features like commiting.

3) How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change? 

We need to check the status, for this have to write command "git status".
